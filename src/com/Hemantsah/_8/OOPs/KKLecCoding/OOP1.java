//1. dot operator linked the ref. variable/object ref. with instance variable(variable present in object). Eg. objName.name ===> "Hemant"
//2. How to create object?: by using new keyword. It dynamically allocates the memory at run time and return the refrence to it and this refrence is pointed by ref. variable.
//3. Why we don't use "new" keyword for creating primitive data types?: Becoz primitive data types are not object. Hence they are stored in stack memory.
