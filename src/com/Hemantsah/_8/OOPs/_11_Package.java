//1. It is arrange no. of class, interfaces, and sub-package of same type into a particular group.
//2. Advantage: 1.Reusability 2.Security 3.Fast Searching
//3. package is a mechanism for organizing Java classes into namespaces, which provides a structured and manageable way to handle large codebases. Packages help avoid name conflicts, control access, and make locating and using classes easier
//Types: Two
            //1. pre-defined   2.user-defined :See from notes


//Key Concepts of Packages:
//1. Organization: Packages help organize classes and interfaces in a logical manner. For example, classes related to database operations can be placed in a database package, while classes related to user interface can be placed in a ui package.
//
//2. Namespace Management: Packages create a namespace that prevents naming conflicts. Two classes with the same name can exist in different packages without any issue.
//
//3. Access Control: Packages also provide access control. Classes in the same package can access each otherâ€™s package-private members (those without an explicit access modifier), while classes outside the package cannot.
//
//4. Reusability: By organizing related classes into packages, it becomes easier to reuse code across different projects.
